# CLAUDE.md — Qiskit Fall Fest 2026 site

Website for Qiskit Fall Fest 2026, organized by the Quantum Computing Initiative
at Khalifa University as part of IBM Quantum’s annual global event series.

## Confirmed timing

- **19 October 2026 at 6:00 PM UAE time (UTC+04:00)** — opening session and countdown target
- **31 October – 1 November 2026** — closing showcases (the Fall Fest ends 1 November)
- **10 October 2026** — team target for the site to be live

Never restore a previous unconfirmed closing date or regional-superlative claim.
The middle phase is the “development period”, not a “challenge period”.

## Stack

Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind v4 with a static export
(`output: "export"`). The development server runs on port 4321. There is no backend,
CMS, or database.

Tailwind and `@tailwindcss/postcss` are pinned to the same exact version. Do not loosen
the versions: incompatible `@tailwindcss/oxide` versions can break the scanner.

## Content architecture

**Components do not own event data. Content lives in `src/content/`.**

Dates, names, public descriptions, page headings, partner details, links, and CTA copy
must be editable without opening a component. Shared components consume shared content
exports. See `src/content/README.md` for the file map.

## Content honesty

- Never list a sponsor, speaker, department, or partner that has not agreed in writing.
- Use `confirmed`, `planning`, `tentative`, and `tba` accurately.
- The six tracks are in the **Planning phase**. National tracks are hybrid and
  international tracks are virtual; do not publish difficulty, prerequisites,
  algorithms, datasets, judging criteria, or partner details yet.
- Do not invent attendance numbers, eligibility rules, team rules, workloads, closing
  dates, speaker formats, or selection processes.
- Keep the empty `speakers` array until people agree to be announced.
- Where a format or session time is unknown, omit the optional field.

These values are canonical in `src/content/event.ts`; components should not duplicate them.

## Static assets and GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages may serve the site under a repository base path. Do not use a bare public
URL such as `/fall-fest-assets/image.png`. Use `fallFestAssets` or `withBasePath` from
`src/content/assets.ts`; `next.config.ts` exposes the resolved base path as
`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` during the build.

Use web-safe event-photo derivatives in pages while preserving the supplied originals:

- `hackathon.jpg` (original: `hackathon image.CR2`)
- `bootcamp-web.jpg` (original: `Bootcamp.JPG`)
- `ibm-quantum-wordmark.png` for the cropped partner wordmark

## Design system

Tokens live in `src/app/globals.css`. Never hardcode a color in a component. Use
`color-mix(in srgb, var(--c-token) N%, transparent)` for translucent values.

Both themes must have zero WCAG AA contrast failures. Maintain visible keyboard focus,
44×44 px mobile targets, meaningful alternative text, scalable type, and information
that does not rely on color alone.

## Motion and custom pointer

Motion may use `transform` and `opacity`, and must switch off under
`prefers-reduced-motion` with content remaining visible. The custom Bloch pointer must
also respect reduced motion, fine-pointer capability, keyboard use, and mobile/touch.
Never hide the native cursor unless the replacement is active and safe.

`Reveal` has a failsafe because `IntersectionObserver` may not fire in background tabs.
Do not make content permanently dependent on an animation callback.

## Gotchas

- Two display utilities on one element resolve by stylesheet order, not class order.
  Wrap the element when responsive visibility conflicts with a component’s own display.
- Do not run `npm run build` while `npm run dev` is running. Both write `.next`, which
  can produce misleading static-worker or `/_not-found` failures.

## Verification before completion

```bash
npm run build
```

Then check all six routes in dark and light themes at 375, 768, and 1280 px. Confirm no
console errors, horizontal overflow, missing base-path assets, inaccessible controls, or
legacy event claims. Test keyboard navigation and reduced motion.
